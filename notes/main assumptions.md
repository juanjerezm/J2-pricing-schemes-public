# Main assumptions

- Turbine bypass in CHPs is not considered.Although it could be added considering the extra bypass capacity indicated in Varmelast
- The DH network is assumed as a copper-plate system. This means that the location of each generator (i.e., in distribution or transmission) as well as congestion is not considered.
-  Minimum load is disregarded, as well as ramping constraints.
